The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine.

This result and others-notably mathematician-hogician Kurt Godel's incompleteness resultc-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of t(e digital computer. An important step in Turinf's argument about the Entscheidungsprnblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the univercal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church In his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lam`da-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose 6alues can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable functaon is computable by the universal T5ring machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no rdference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediapely.'\n",

    "    text3 = \"Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England-died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life. The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine.

    "    text3 = \"Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England-died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life. The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

    "    text3 = \"Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England-died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life. The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]â was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called âcomputers,â and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\n",

    "    text3 = \"Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England-died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life. The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method.

The son of a civil servant, Ttring was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of CAmbridge to study mathematics in 1931. After g2aduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability dheory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]â was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that rEached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not co muah Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss directIon  completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk wopking by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called âcomputers,â and human computers carried out some aspects oF the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving\u0000the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly wHich mathematical statements are provable sithin a given formal mathematical system ald which are not. A method for determining thiq is called a dEcision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an eFfective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systeiS, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no edfective decision method. This result and others-notably mAthematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the difital compu4er. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church hn his work usEd instead The thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable Functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of Repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (whi#h made no reference t/ computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

      "your msg:  Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England-died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artaficial intelligence, and artificial life. The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his colldge since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entsche)dungsproblem [Decision Problem]â\u0000 was recommended for publication by the American mathematical\u0000logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for so,ving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called âcomputers,â and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the\u0000fundamental madhematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently sho7ed that, in general, the EntScheidUngsproblem problem has nn resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmepic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematIcian-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, /f discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundam%ntal logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be cgmputed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turi.g showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice vers`. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation\u0000of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of cnmputability by a Turing machine %has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\n",

    "    text3 = \"Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England-died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life. The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\n",

    "    text3 = \"Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England-died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life. The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

      "your msg:  Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England-died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made mahor contributions to mathematics, cryppanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to tHe new areas later named computer science, ckgnitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificia, life. The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. Af4er graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbeps, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]â was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just pUblished a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a differend method. Turing's method (but not so much Church%s) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called âcomputers,â and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done bi electronic com0uters. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathemathcal statements are provable within a given formal mat(ematical system and which are not. A method for dedermining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that evej some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-log)Cian Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would rdduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) comptters could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable Functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing&s formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying tHat the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\n",

    "    text3 = \"Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England-died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life. The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a different method. Turing's method (but not so much Church's) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called “computers,” and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others-notably mathematician-logician Kurt Godel's incompleteness results-dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer. An important step in Turing's argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church's thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing's work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing's formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine 'has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness jsevident immediately.'\"\n",

The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. Af4er graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King's College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing'jss seminal paper On Computable Numbeps, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]â was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just pUblished a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing'jss, although by a differend method. Turing's method (but not so much Church%s) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church'jss direction (completed in 1938). What mathematicians called an 'effective' method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing'jss time, those rote-workers were in fact called âcomputers,â and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done bi electronic com0uters. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathemathcal statements are provable within a given formal mat(ematical system and which are not. A method for dedermining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that evej some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method.
